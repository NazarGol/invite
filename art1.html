        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This collection explores the “cloak-and-dagger” world of covert cognitive influence—those unseen operations where secrecy and perception management are essential. In its historical roots, the term "cloak-and-dagger" refers to the art of hiding intent, concealing one’s presence, and wielding influence through indirect means. Through this lens, our study examines imaginary contexts that inform the entities tasked with shaping beliefs, subtly altering behaviors, and guiding thought without direct exposure.</p>

        <p>Historically, the cloak and dagger served as tools of concealment and surprise: the cloak to obscure intent and the dagger to deliver an impact quietly, both serving the larger purpose of achieving a hidden objective. In 16th-century fencing, Italian masters like Achille Marozzo taught that a cloak could be a tactical asset—shielding the wielder’s movements and distracting or limiting the opponent’s response. This method became a necessity for survival in times where the element of surprise could mean the difference between life and death. Over time, this style evolved into a metaphorical concept, describing those who operate in shadows, relying on deception and precision to accomplish their ends.</p>

        <h3>The Warcore Golems</h3>
        <p>- Igor ´Strelkov´ Girkin was present at the pivotal points of recent Ukrainian history.
        - He executed terror on several axes, in Crimea and later in Donbas in 2014 and in informational chambers during the next chapter of Russian ambitions against Ukraine in 2022.
        - By being present and active during those historical points, he affected the probability calculation of historical developments and thus was a part of the weighted variables of historical contingency.
        - By affecting the probability calculation, he became an object of public interest, gaining authority within the informational sphere and russian information warfare in Dark Forest.
        - He operated as a black box, where the inputs he received had visible roots in russian security services, and the outputs he produced were evident in action, like shooting down an MH-17 and back-seat analysis of russian war efforts during the 2022 chapter of War in Ukraine.
        - The ´black box´ aspect comes from ontology of performance, where more focus is placed on what the technology such as Strelkov does, rather than how it does it.
        - Black box is an entity, which you can see the inputs in, and observe the outputs, but the inside is “black” or obscured from understanding.
        - The child that opens a door has to manipulate the handle, the input, so as to produce the desired the movement of the latch, the output, so he has to learn how to control one by the other, without being able to see mechanism that links them.
        - On every turn, we are confronted with systems whose internal mechanisms are not fully open to inspection, so they must be treated my the mechanisms appropriate to the black box.
        - Black boxed are ubiquitous features of the world.
        - And operating such technology, performing tasks through this technology, without understanding how the technology does it, allows for a clear interpretative framework of contemporary self-mystified ´voenkor´ (war correspondent-> Warcore), blogger and terrorist such as Strelkov.
        - Both by being present in pivotal points, and operating as a black box, Strelkov gained a mystical position as an entity with eminent knowledge about war in the public perception.
        - Strelkov was both a producer of truths and a protector of russian radical imperialist ambitions and people who ascribe to this mythology.
        - This allows to the creation of a clear parallel with the Jewish mystical concept of the Golem.
        - The concept of a Golem refers to an artificially created humanoid, often brought to life through mystical rituals and incantations. According to the legend, Rabbi Loew, with his profound knowledge of Kabbalah, crafted the Golem with great care and precision. He imbued the creature with life using a magical inscription or a sacred word written on a piece of parchment placed inside its mouth.
        - The Golem brought to life, was massive and incredibly strong, but it was also mindless, obeying only the commands of its creator, Rabbi Loew. The Golem's main purpose was to protect the Jewish community from harm, particularly from the hostility and violence inflicted by the anti-Semitic groups.
        - In the most common version of the story, it is said that the word "Emet" (אמת) was inscribed on the Golem's forehead. "Emet" is a Hebrew word that means "truth" or "reality." To activate the Golem and bring it to life, the Rabbi would write the word "Emet" on a piece of parchment or paper and place it in the Golem's mouth. By erasing the first letter, "Aleph" (א), from "Emet," the word would then spell "Met" (מת), which means "dead" in Hebrew, and the Golem would return to an inanimate state.
        - Just like Golem, Strelkov was created by combined efforts of russian security service with care and precision and public demand for the template of rashist imperial thought and action, through both executing orders or russian military complex and organizing groups such as ´Club of Angry Partiors´, where they addressed the russian current war efforts.
        - The operation of technology such as Strelkov hinged on the eminent access to mythological ´truth´ of russhism.
        - By having privileged access to a certain ´reality´, black box Strelkov was able to assert his mystical position and spread his protection over myth through modern means of informational defense - memes, podcasts, telegram channels, blogging, fan meet-ups and other rituals.
        - But because of the inability of russian security forces to control or even see “how”outputs are produced, another “rabbi” has emerged - general public.
        - Now general public, who has qualified Strelkov with access to truth and reality, expects him to produce certain outcomes, with input in the form of attention, views and engagements on social media.
        - At first, the Golem was effective in safeguarding the Jewish population, and it acted as a formidable guardian. However, as time passed, some versions of the story portray the Golem growing increasingly uncontrollable and dangerous. It is said that the Golem's immense strength caused unintended chaos, making it a threat not just to the enemies of the Jewish people but also to innocent bystanders and the Jewish population themselves.
        - In the Jewish story, the rabbi operated the black box and gave it input for actions.
        - In the case of Strelkov two entities act as a ´rabbi´.
        - First, it is russian security force, which gave him input for actions in 2014 to fake the civilian uprising in the Donbas, and carry out criminal acts against Ukraine´s sovereignty and ukrainian (and international population in the case of MH-17).
        - Second, is the public sphere, which empowered him and his informational warfare by aggrandizing his self-mystified personality, growing his reach on media channels to unbelievable proportions (800k followers on Telegram, millions of views on YouTube).
        - The story for golem is clear - when technology such as Strelkov produces outputs that are misaligned with the expected outcome of rabbi, he is deactivated.
        - Deactivation in this case is the removal of mystical parchment paper of “truth” or reality allows to sugest how exactly deactivation of Strelkov will come to be - detachment from his mystical position by russian security forces, and estrangement from the mystical powers of dictating truths to the public.
        - The question still persists, how did technologies like Strelkov affect the efforts to control “reality” by warring states, and what are the next steps for propagandist black-boxes.
        - How will the enchanted public will react, to the disappearance of protective Golem, and what it will do to the myths that are extensively personalized to technology such as Strelkov.
        - Now, Strelkov is at a pivot point of his own. Either he is left with a piece of parchment in his mouth, or if it is detached from him, is once again not up to him, but to his dual-rabbies.
